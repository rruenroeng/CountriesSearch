# The Purpose of This App

This application works with the restcountries.com search APIs to return countries based on a few different criteria: Name, Full Name, and Country Code. It has a PHP backend and a React frontend.

# Prerequisite Software to Install

1. Install [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which should bring Node along with it.
2. Install [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php).

# Getting Started With Countries Display App

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Navigate to a terminal within the project.
3. Enter `npm install` to get the node libraries downloaded and installed.
4. Run `./server` in one terminal to get the PHP server running.
5. From a different terminal, run `npm start` to get the client going.

# Notes From The Author

- This is a pretty good pass at the prompt, but could be improved with more time.
- This is the first time I've ever coded in PHP. I didn't have time for a lot of formal training, but I think I handled the basics. If you have feedback/advice for how I could make it better/follow better standards I am all ears.
- I'll take feedback on any of the project, really. I had a lot of fun getting this to work.
- I'd forgotten how difficult CORS errors can be. Some people made this wonderful resource: [Solve CORS Errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
- I have regions and sub-regions return as "???" if they aren't specified from the API. While I was testing, there were islands that didn't have sub-regions specified that were causing the app to crash.
- Thank you for the opportunity to apply to Infosec.

# Enjoy!
